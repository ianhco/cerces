# Migrate 1.0 to 1.1

Contains 3 minor breaking changes.

---

#### `basePath` -> `rootPath` <Badge text="replaced" type="danger" />
- `basePath` has been removed due to not meeting standard.
- `rootPath` has been added as a replacement for `basePath` and now meets standard and supports Cloudflare Workers route patterns.
- While functionality did not change much, the generated schemas and APIs is drastically different, this breaking change was intended to inform users that they are different.

#### `Middleware.of` <Badge text="removed" type="danger" />
- Init parameter `of` has been removed from `Middleware`, users should simply declare the env type using generic `Middleware<Env>`. 

#### `App.tags` -> `Apps.tagsInfo` <Badge text="renamed" type="warning" />
- Init parameter and property `tags` of `App` renamed to `tagsInfo` due to naming conflict with base class `Router`.
